## What is web accessibility?

Web accessibility means creating websites and digital content so that everyone can use them effectively, regardless of their abilities. It ensures people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities can navigate, understand, and interact with online content just as easily as anyone else.

## What is a web accessibility specialist?

A web accessibility specialist is a champion of digital inclusion by becoming an expert in how diverse users experience the web. They have deep knowledge of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and work with teams to create digital spaces that truly work for everyone - whether they use screen readers, keyboard navigation, voice commands, or other assistive technologies. They bridge the gap between technical standards and real human needs, ensuring no user faces barriers to digital content.
