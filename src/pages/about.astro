		I am a white, cisgender, bi/pan, progressive, anti-racist, anti-fascist, urban cyclist, girl dad, trekkie, whovian. I was born and raised in rural southeastern Illinois and have lived in Springfield IL, Link√∂ping Sweden, and for the past ~12 years ping-ponged back and forth between Washington DC and the Pacific Northwest. Currently, I live in North Portland with my partner, two littles, and a Fika dog.

		Prior to making the switch to accessibilty advocacy, I was a front-end web developer at an <a href="https://seattlewebdesign.com" target="_blank">agency in Seattle</a> and have an academic background in Political Science and International Relations. My career started in the non-profit/association space working on special projects and quickly realized that I excelled most when using code to make things more beautiful and efficient.
