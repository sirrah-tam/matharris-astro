		Prior to making the switch to accessibilty advocacy, I was a front-end web developer at an agency in Seattle and have an academic background in Political Science and International Relations. My career started in the non-profit/association space working on special projects and quickly realized that I excelled most when using code to make things more beautiful and efficient.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-8">
		I have several years experience in web development using semantic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WAI-ARIA, PHP, SQL, Git with working knowledge of WordPress and Laravel development.
