## Hello world!

This is my very first post on my own website, I've never hosted any of my own writing before so this is kind of neat. It's also pretty scary to put your own things out there, but here we are. It's scary out there these days and I've needed a place to come and share my thoughts. This is going to be that place. I don't know how often I'll keep it updated and will likely always be considered under construction. 

I plan on writing about what's going on in the world, what I've been working on, and just random thoughts as I see fit to publish. 

Thanks for stopping by,

-- Mat
