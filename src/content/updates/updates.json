My partner was caught up in the mess of probationary firings &amp; RIFs at HHS and we decided that things were a bit too uncertain out here, especially while trying to raise two littles. We're going to live with the grandparents for the summer and then are heading to Spokane, WA in August for our next chapter of life. We're going to try and settle for bit, put down some roots while the littles grow."
